# Car Race

Just a simple endless run car race game; inspired by a game in a brick game way back 80's (or 90's? Actually I don't know, I'm sorry).

The concept of the game is similar, the score increases while your distance increases. The difference is, in that game, you must select the speed of the game from the beginning, while in this game, the speed increases over the time (I set it to every 15 seconds).

# This game is still in development

## About the game

You are going too fast in the highway (Be careful not to be caught). Just dodge all the white cars.
Your score is at the top left corner of the "screen".

I developed this game with VueJS, using NuxtJS Framework.

I drew all of the images using [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/), and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

## Controls

- **Left arrow key** Move left
- **Right arrow key** Move right

## Testing on local computer

### 1. Getting the repository

If you do not have the repository on your device yet, you may clone this repository by executing the command below on the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/takaneichinose/car-race.git
```

But if you already have the reposity, just pull to get the latest code.

```
cd car-race
git pull
```

Now you have the latest codebase.

### 2. Building the source code

I created this game using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), so make sure you have NodeJS installed on your device. Install the dependencies by executing the command below.

```
npm install
```

Now you have the dependencies installed.

### 3. Run the server

To run the server on your local device, just execute the command line below, and wait for [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) to finish compiling.

```
npm start
```

After compiling, you're ready to go, and enjoy the game!
