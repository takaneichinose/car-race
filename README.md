Just a simple endless run car race game; inspired by a game in a brick game way back 90's (or 80's? Actually I don't know, I'm sorry).

The concept of the game is similar, the score increases while your distance increases. The difference is, in that game, you must select the speed of the game from the beginning, while in this game, the speed increases over the time (I set it to every 5 seconds).

## About the game

You are going too fast in the highway (Be careful not to be caught). Just dodge all the white cars.
Your score is at the top left corner of the "screen".

## Controls

- **Left arrow key** Move left
- **Right arrow key** Move right
